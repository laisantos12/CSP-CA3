                <h2>Starters</h2>
                <h3>Scallop Pies</h3>
                <p>Scallop pies, with their local shellfish and locally-invented curry powder are a truly regional dish.
                    Tourists in Tasmania might take the advice of that 1933 visitor who had tracked scallops down to a
                    fish shop where they were sold for fourpence a dozen fresh or a shilling and sixpence for a
                    plateful, fried.</p>
                <h3>Chilli and Herb Calamari</h3>
                <p>Crispy golden squid with coriander, peanuts and chilli, great as a snack, a starter or serve with
                    rice for to make it a main. </p>
                <h3>Burrata bruschetta</h3>
                <p>Burrata is a fresh Italian cheese made with fresh mozzarella and cream, and it looks like a pouch of
                    godliness. When loaded on top of garlicky rustic bruschetta and sprinkled with oven roasted
                    tomatoes, it creates a food for the gods.</p>

                <h2>Main Dishes</h2>
                <h3>Spinach Gnocchi</h3>
                <p>Spinach gnocchi, often combined with ricotta, is one of the many variations of the classic potato
                    gnocchi. Spinach Ricotta Gnocchi originate in Tuscany, and they look more like irregularly shaped
                    dumplings, which earned them their Italian name Malfatti, which literally means "badly made."</p>
                <h3>Honey Mustard Stuffed Chicken</h3>
                <p>It’s a delicious piece of toasted ciabatta, topped with a succulent chicken breast, tomato slices,
                    crispy bacon, draped with melted mozzarella cheese, and finally, drizzled with honey mustard sauce.
                    Ohhh boy. It’s as good as it sounds – well, reads, if we’re being technical here.</p>
                <h3>Spicy Lentil & Root Vegetable Casserole</h3>
                <p>A delicious, spicy casserole made with lentils, herbs and fresh root vegetables.</p>

                <h2>Desserts</h2>
                <h3>Tiramisu</h3>
                <p>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert consisting of layers of sponge cake soaked in coffee and brandy or
                    liqueur with
                    powdered chocolate and mascarpone cheese.</p>
                <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
                <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer
                    consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta),
                    eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from
                    crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.
                    Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated). Cheesecake is usually sweetened
                    with sugar and may be flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or
                    other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be
                    added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce,
                    chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.</p>
                <h3>English Custard</h3>
                <p>Custards baked in pastry (custard tarts) were very popular in the Middle Ages, and are the origin of
                    the English word 'custard': the French term 'croustade' originally referred to the crust of a
                    tart, and is derived from the Italian word crostata, and ultimately the Latin crustāre.
                    Examples include Crustardes of flessh and Crustade, in the 14th century English collection The Forme
                    of Cury. These recipes include solid ingredients such as meat, fish, and fruit bound by the
                    custard. Stirred custards cooked in pots are also found under the names Creme Boylede and
                    Creme boiled. Some custards especially in the Elizabethan era used marigold (calendula) to give
                    the custard color. </p>
